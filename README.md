### Flagship info

I call this the **Flagship** simply because I use it and have been using it since its inception and it's the DE I love and contribute to the most. It can be unstable at times however, since it's constantly evolving and keeps getting new features non stop making the most customizable/riceable DE out there. That's why I love it so much. So it's targeted to anyone who likes that level of tinkering...

### GTK Theming

In case you use **GTK4/LibAdwaita** apps, you will have to Launch the toolkit from the dock, head on over to **Customization** select option `u` to apply the fix & update both GTK as well as KDE themes to latest versions from source. Only works for the default 🎨**Layan Theme**🎨.
